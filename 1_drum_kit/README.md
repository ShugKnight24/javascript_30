# JavaScript Drum Kit

### 11/6/2017

**Thoughts**: This was a fairly simple, yet informative tutorial, and I really enjoyed going through it. A couple of things I really learned.

  - The `<kbd>` tag in HTML

    - I've never seen it before, but apparently you can use it to denote keyboard input. Pretty cool. I'm going to look into it some more.

  - Similarly, I've never seen the `<audio>` HTML tag before

  - keycode.info

    - I did not know that this website existed. I typically Google or search Stack Overflow for what keyCode corresponds to a particular keyboard button. I'll start using this site as a quick reference.

  - Template Literals

    - using the `backtick` to surround a string that can contain a placeholder. I found that to be pretty nifty.

    - i.e `${placeholder}`

  - I don't often break out the code that I place in event listeners. I will if it is a repetitive function that I call in many different places, but this is something that I need to get better at doing. I need to make my code more modular so it doesn't have to be modified in many locations and can easily be transported where it needs to be.

  - I'm not sure what else I'd like to add functionality wise, but I may revisit this in the future to do just that.

    - The only thing I can really think of is better key mapping so that all the keys are not on the same line of the keyboard.

    - I may also come back to change the styles, but we'll see about that.
