# JavaScript 30

*Update - 4/6/2021:* Funny seeing my own commentary

**Note**: I will be using this repo to track my progress with Wes Bos' course, [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/). I heard about JavaScript 30 a long time ago and I wanted to get into it, but never did. I am creating this repo in order to to create some accountability and start tracking my progress as I slowly make my way through this program. By completing this course, I hope to improve my skills with Vanilla JavaScript, ES6, and my approach to programmatic thinking in general.

I will update this README as I complete projects within the course.
