**Thoughts**: I found today's tutorial really awesome. Things I learned:

  - You can use variables in CSS and update those variables via JavaScript! That is badass.

  - :root - the highest level you can target in CSS. Similar to targeting the document itself. This is useful for creating global CSS variables.

  - You declare a CSS variable using --varName as the property and set the value to whatever you want.

  - You can then use the variables you declared in CSS by using var(--varName) as a css declaration's value.

  - querySelector returns a NodeList

### Future Improvements

  - I'd like to add some more variables and play around with manipulating them.

    - I can definitely see a use for these CSS variables right away. I made a few GUIs for the company I work for, and I think using CSS variables in conjunction with data attributes may be a great way of improving the manner I update dynamic content. It will be something I have to revisit in the future.
