# Array Cardio

### 11/9/2017

**Thoughts**: I've played around with some of these higher order functions in the past. Mostly, it was due to being exposed to Fun Fun Function's functional programming [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84). It is a great resource and I would highly recommend checking that playlist out! MPJ has a great teaching ability and his personality kept me engaged the entire time.

I enjoyed getting some extra practice with filter, map, reduce, and sort. It was also nice seeing how they could be used with different data sets, data sets that I could see myself working with in the future. I particularly enjoyed the example where he went to Wikipedia to pull data for the boulevard names. I often do things similar to this with jQuery, but these techniques would improve how quickly I accomplish the tasks I am trying to do.

  - I need to get better with these in general.

### Future Improvements

  - I need to practice more with JavaScript higher order functions to become comfortable using them whenever I need to. I want to be confident that I am using them correctly and that I understand how I can chain them together to make use of their full potential. We don't use ES6 at work, but that doesn't mean that I can't begin to implement them in various side projects. I think there are also some backend GUIs that aren't client facing that I can begin to improve by using higher order functions.
