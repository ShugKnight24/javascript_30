# Custom HTML5 Video Player

### 11/19/2017

**Thoughts**: This was a good lesson, I really enjoyed going through it.

Things I learned:

- This video seemed like it built up on the content of the previous lessons.

  - I enjoyed seeing ternarys set in variables and then using those variables to update other values.

  - This is the type of thought process I want to follow and the readable code I want to be able to write. Not only will this make my own development process easier, but it will allow me to write code that is easier to read and easier to collaborate on.

- I enjoyed seeing the different properties of the video and how they could be used to manipulate how the video played and updating the value of the progress bar.

### Future Improvements

- As Wes suggests, adding a button to increase the size of the video to fullscreen.

  - Hitting that button again would reduce the video to its original size.

- A feature that I'm upset YouTube doesn't have is a loop button that would replay the video when it is finished if the loop button is on.

  - Figure out the best way to handle this

- Make the progress bar start initially at zero

  - Technically it does if you hit autoplay

- I will look at some other video sites and see how I can improve this player.
