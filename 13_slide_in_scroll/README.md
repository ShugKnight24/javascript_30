# Slide In On Scroll

### 11/21/2017

**Thoughts**: This was an enjoyable lesson. I did something similar to this in an earlier project where I would only load images if they were in the viewport.

Things I Learned:

- I typically use throttle at work, but I was fortunate to see this lesson because there is a problem I am trying to solve that debounce looks like it would be perfect for.

- I need to get more familiar with all of the different properties that exist on different objects in the DOM.

  - I really liked how Wes used these different properties to create variables that helped to solve the problem he was encountering.

  - The knowledge of all of these properties would better allow an individual to understand what information they can use to solve any problem they encounter. I suppose this is something that I will get better at with time.

- I need to get better at creating variables that I can plug in to conditional logic to make my work more readable.

  - I really liked seeing this done.

### Future Improvements

- I'm not a huge fan of the scroll in effect that was used. It feels clunky to me.

  - I may play around with different effects to see which one I like best and see if I need to approach the problem any differently to solve it.

- I may play around with sliding in content that isn't an image. Like a paragraph or a header.

  - I probably would like this effect even less, but I would want to see how it could be achieved.
