**Thoughts**: This was a good lesson and the content may help me refactor a project I build where I would only load images pulled from a database if they were in the viewport.

Things I Learned:

- I typically use `.throttle()` at work. Using a `debounce` may help fix problems I've ecounered when using throttle.

- I plan on getting more familiar with the different properties that exist on different objects in the DOM. The only way I can do this will be by building more projects.

  - Liked how Wes used different properties as create variables to solve the problem in a creative manner.

  - The knowledge of these properties would better allow someone to understand what information is available to solve a problem they encounter. This is something that will improve with time and practice.

- I plan on getting better at creating flexible variables that can be plugged into conditional logic to make the code more readable.

### Future Improvements

- I'm not a huge fan of the scroll in effect that was used. It feels clunky to me.

  - I may test different effects to see which ones I like best and see if I'm able to approach the problem differently to solve it.

- I will also test sliding in different content and seeing how that looks
