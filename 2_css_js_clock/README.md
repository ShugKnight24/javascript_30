# CSS + JS Clock

### 11/7/2017
**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed this tutorial. It was pretty brief, but I gained a lot of information out of it. Here's what I learned:
  - `transform-origin`
    - Change the position where a transform occurs.
  - I enjoyed playing around with the JavaScript `Date()` object. It's something I would like to explore more in the future.
  - I'm also enjoying getting more practice with vanilla JavaScript as I typically rely more heavily on jQuery.
    - Also, we don't use ES6 at my job, but I've really enjoyed getting some practice with template literals. They are really cool and I can definitely see how they would be beneficial.

### Future Improvements
  - ~~I want to add numbers to the appropriate positions on the face of the clock~~ - âœ… 
  - I want to fix the transform event when the second hand hits the top of the clock.
  - I didn't really enjoy the background styles, I may try to turn the clock into some sort of grandfather clock with a pendulum.
