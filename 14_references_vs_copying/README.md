# Objects and Arrays - References vs Copying

### 11/23/2017

**Thoughts**: It was fun playing around with the different techniques used on both arrays and objects. I was familiar with a few of these, and after going through a couple of examples, it began to make more sense, but it was nice to get an opportunity to play with things I don't typically do at work. Been really enjoying this JavaScript 30 course thus far. It really does teach you how to approach problems you face in a different manner.

Things I learned:

- Using `slice()` on an array without any arguments will copy an array

- I haven't used `concat()` in the past

  - It is a method that allows you to create a new array that contains two or more combined arrays

    - I think there are some previous projects I've worked on where using a `concat()` may have been the correct solution as opposed to the method I used. I'll try to revisit and refactor that work.

- I've played with the spread operator `...`, primarily when learning React and dealing with state or different objects within it, but I've rarely used it as I don't typically write ES6

  - It was nice to get a solid explanation and understanding about it.

### Future Improvements

- I need to learn as much as I possibly can about manipulating arrays and objects in the most efficient manner possible.
