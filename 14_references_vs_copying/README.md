**Thoughts**: Fun playing  with the different arrays and object techniques. While familiar with some of these, going through the examples began to make more sense, and solidified my knowledge and understanding. Always good to gain a different perspective and see how to approach or even see something you face in a different manner.

Things I learned:

- Using `slice()` on an array without any arguments will copy an array

- Using `concat()` on a blank array will create a copy

  - It is a method that allows you to create a new array that contains two or more combined arrays

  - [MDN Concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)

- I've used the spread operator `...`, primarily with state in React
  - Good to get a better explanation and understanding about it.

## Future Improvements

- Interacting with and manipulating both arrays and objects is a huge part in JavaScript when dealing with data / APIs. Improving my understanding will allow me to be more efficient.
