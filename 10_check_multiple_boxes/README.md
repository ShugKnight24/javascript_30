# Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes

### 11/18/2017

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed this lesson, and it taught me a few things about how to change my approach when attempting to solve a problem I am faced with.

Things I learned:

- I still need to get better at using the `event` object.

  - When I initially implemented my own solution, I used `keycode === 16` to check if the shift key was being pressed. Apparently, the `event` object has a property called `.shiftKey` which checks to see if the shift key is currently being pressed down.

- I also liked seeing how Wes used variables as flags that he would use later to accomplish a task he needed to.

  - I need to get better at this practice.

### Future Improvements

- Prevent it from selecting multiple checkboxes if the user is holding shift when the first time they click an empty checkbox

- If a user has the ability to select multiple checkboxes using shift, I think adding a button as an override that checks all or unchecks all could be useful as well.

#### Shout Out

I've been really enjoying covering a lot of different programming content lately, but specifically really enjoy the content that @WesBos puts out. I have really enjoyed going through the first third of JavaScript 30, and I think I'm going to pick up his [ES6 course](https://es6.io/) when I'm done with this. This is one thing I truly enjoy about people who put out free content on the internet. If their teaching manner resonates with me and they help me grow at no cost, I want to support them in the future.

This is somewhat of a mental shift I have gone through. When I was younger, I would pirate music, movies, books, etc. I was some sort of weird obsession with collecting everything I could. One thing I would download all the time was things for self-improvement. After illegally downloading those files, I would rarely if ever use them. Now that I have the ability to buy things, I still want to invest in courses and products that improve skills I want to get better at, but I am much more willing to separate from the money and compensate the people who are creating these amazing products.

Going through this course has definitely more confident in my own abilities and made me a better developer. I need to continue to cover as much content as I possibly can in order to continue to grow as a dev. Thank you for what you do Wes!
