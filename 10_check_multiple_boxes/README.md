**Thoughts**: This lesson taught me how to change my approach when attempting to solve programmatic problems

Things I learned:

- Get better at using the `event` object.

  - I initially implemented a version that used `keycode === 16` to check if the shift key was being pressed. The `event` object has a property called `shiftKey` which checks to see if the shift key is currently being pressed down.

- Wes used variables as flags that he would use later to accomplish a task he needed to
  - Continue to improve using this approach

### Future Improvements

- Prevent it from selecting multiple checkboxes if the user is holding shift when the first time they click an empty checkbox

- ~~Adding a button that checks or unchecks all as an override~~ - âœ…

#### Shout Out

Really enjoying covering a lot of different programming content lately, specifically enjoy the content that @WesBos puts out.  Thanks for what you do Wes! Has been fun refactoring the first third of JavaScript 30. I picked up his [ES6 course](https://es6.io/) and will tackle it when I'm done with this. This is what is cool about the internet, it's so much easier to support creators that resonate with you. If they help me grow at no cost, I want to pay it forward and support them in the future.

This a mental shift I went through and continue to tackle. When I was younger, I would pirate music, movies, books, etc. I was obsessed with collecting everything I could. I still struggle with digital hoarding. The thing with self-improvement that I've learned is that anything will work if you stick with it and apply yourself. The list of things I can improve at will never shorten, it will only continue to grow. I'm doing my best to be intentional about how I spend my time and focus it on the areas that are truly important to me.

This course has made me more confident in my own abilities and improved me as a developer. I will continue to improve my dev abilities so I can bring my ideas into reality
