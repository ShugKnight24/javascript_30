# Array Cardio Day 2

### 11/11/2017

**Thoughts**:

Things I learned:

- I learned that you can wrap a variable with curly brackets in a console.log to print the variable name along with the value of the variable.

  - This is super useful to me because I'll often write something like `console.log('variableName: ', variableName);`

  - I could just do `console.log({variableName});`

- It was fun getting practice with `some()` and `every()`.

  - I've never used either before and I can see how both would be beneficial

- `find()` and `findIndex()` were both really console

  - I could definitely make use of these when I have the value I am searching against in an array

- I need to get more practice using the `...` (spread operator)

  - I need to look up some resources about the proper use so I can better understand when to use it

- I enjoyed getting some practice shortening the longer functions into shorter arrows functions with implicit returns

### Future Improvements

- Like in the first instance of array cardio, I need to get better with ES6 in general. Going through this course, covering as much JavaScript as I possibly can, continuing to practice, and continuing to improve will lead me to getting better as a JavaScript dev. I'm excited to continue on this journey of growth.
