# Array Cardio Day 2

### 3/28/2021
- Refactor JS
  - Use destructuring, fix spacing, remove comments
- Update README
### 11/11/2017

**Thoughts**:

Things I learned:

- I learned that you can wrap variables with curly brackets in a console.log to print the variable name along with the value of the variable.
  - This is super useful to me because I'll often write something like `console.log('variableName: ', variableName);`
  - I could just do `console.log({variableName});`
- It was fun getting practice with `some()` and `every()`.
  - I've never used either before and I can see how both would be beneficial
- `find()` and `findIndex()`
  - I could definitely make use of these when I have the value I am searching against in an array
- I will get more practice using the `...` (spread operator)
  - I will look up resources about the proper use so I can understand when to use it
- I enjoy shortening the longer functions into shorter arrows functions with implicit returns
  - Makes the code more readable

### Future Improvements

- Like in the first instance of array cardio, I will get better with ES6. Going through this course, covering as much JavaScript as possible, and continuing to practice will help me grow as a JavaScript dev. Excited to continue on this journey and complete this course
