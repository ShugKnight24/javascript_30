# LocalStorage and Event Delegation

### 11/25/2017

**Thoughts**: I enjoyed going through this lesson and learning about localStorage. I was familiar with the concept, but never implemented anything with localStorage in the past. I am pretty familiar with event delegation due to my use of jQuery. I remember those first few times I was dynamically generating HTML through JavaScript and couldn't wrap my head around why I couldn't select or target those dynamically generated elements.

Things I learned:

- Setting up and implementing localStorage in a project.

- I've used both `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` in the past, but I enjoyed seeing the use cases in this example.

- At work, I've hid the default checkbox inputs and created custom ones, but I didn't use `content:before` / `content:after`.

  - This may be a better solution to implement and I will have to revisit it. It seems to be more clean and less hacky then the manner in which I did it.

### Future Improvements

Even before Wes said these ideas, I wondered about implementing them.

- Adding a check all button

- Adding an uncheck all button

- Adding a delete all button

These would be fun to implement and tying them in with localStorage would be a fun test to see if I truly learned the material.

- I also want to create a small menu that people can select 'popular' food choices from that will populate their own list.
