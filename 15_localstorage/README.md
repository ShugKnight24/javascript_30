**Thoughts**: Great going through this and learning localStorage. I knew localStorage could be used persist data, but never built anything with it or understood how it worked under the hood. I'm familiar with event delegation thanks to JavaScript, & jQuery. When I first learned JavaScript, I couldn't wrap my head around selecting or targeting dynamically generated elements. Now it makes more sense

Things I learned:

- Setting up localStorage in a project.
- Examples of `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`
- Using `content:before` & `content:after`
  - Leveraging this technique may be beneficial and flexible for content changes

## Future Improvements

- ~~Adding a check all button~~ - ✅
- ~~Adding an uncheck all button~~ - ✅
- ~~Adding a delete all button~~ - ✅
- Create a small menu that people can select 'popular' food choices to populate the list.

These will be fun to implement
