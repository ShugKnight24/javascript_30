# Key Sequence Detection

### 11/20/2017

**Thoughts**: This was a fairly short and simple lesson, but it was nice to see how someone could track a users input on a page.

I could see this being beneficial when you wanted a user to type a specific thing and then fire an event specifically once that term was completed.

### Future Improvements

- Make something different occur when the secret code is discovered.

- Create multiple secret codes that have different effects on the page.
