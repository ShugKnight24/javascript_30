# Flex Panels Image Gallery

### 11/9/2017

**Thoughts**: I found this tutorial simple, but I still really enjoyed the content that was covered. I actually really liked the flex panel image gallery, and if the right text is included, I think I would actually prefer it over the typical carousel. I may try to incorporate it into a project I've been working on.

A couple of things I learned:

  - I really enjoyed the use of the method `.includes`

    - I'm going to try to start incorporating this into my code. I think it could quickly improve the readability of my code in specific instances.

  - I enjoyed the brief dive into the `event.propertyName`

    - Something I need to get better at doing is looking into objects available to me and looking through their properties. There is a lot of cool information you can glean from looking into these things. I know I'll get better with time, but taking the time now will pay off in the future.

### Future Improvements

  -  I don't particularly like tying the opening of the panels to a `click`. I think it would be be to add the class on `mouseenter` and remove it on `mouseleave`. It seems clunky when multiple panels are open simultaneously. -> Tried this, led to undesirable bounce between panels. Went with a click that toggles all other panels off
