# AJAX Type Ahead

### 11/11/2017

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed this lesson. I've made a few of these sorting functions for my job and each time I encounter a method of doing it, I'm able to learn a little bit of how to make it better. Going through this lesson makes me want to revisit some of these sorting functions I've written and refactor them.

Things I learned:

- I enjoyed learning about the use of RegExs and how you can set them up. I've used them in the past, and my knowledge on them is not the greatest, but I've seen how powerful they can be and I want to learn how to utilize them properly.

- I really enjoyed learned about `fetch` and working with a promise. I've heard a lot about the utility of promises, but I've never really played with them myself. I am excited to continue to get better so I can feel confident using different techniques and methods.

- It was really cool seeing how quickly sorting through a dataset can be. I know that the dataset that was used was not particularly large and the method of accomplishing the task may not have been the most optimal, but it was cool to see it implemented.

### Future Improvements

- As Wes mentions, I want to look at the dataset a bit more and see what additional information I can sort based off of.

- Adding geolocation would also be really cool.
