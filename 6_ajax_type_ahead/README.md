**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed this lesson. I've made a few sorting functions in the past and each time I see a new way of doing it, I learn how to implement a better version, and inspires me to refactor the sorting functions I've written in the past.

Things I learned:

- I enjoyed learning about Regular Expressions and how they are set up. I've used them in the past, but my knowledge of them is not the greatest. They are extremely powerful and I want to learn how to utilize them optimally - (Still the case ðŸ˜‚)
- I learned about `fetch` and working with promises. I've heard a lot about promises, but never really used them myself. I'm excited improve so I can feel confident using different techniques in different scenarios. - (Have since done quite a bit with promises & async / await)
- It was really cool seeing how quickly sorting through a dataset can be. I know that the dataset that was used was not particularly large and the method of accomplishing the task may not have been the most optimal, but it was cool to see it implemented.

### Future Improvements

- As Wes mentions, I want to look at the dataset a bit more and see what additional information I can sort based off of.
- Adding geolocation would also be really cool.
