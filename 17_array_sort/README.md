# Sorting Band Names without Articles

## 4/7/2021
Focuses on data manipulation within an array. Specifically targeting the contents of a string and ignoring certain key words to create a filter that sorts alphabetically.

## Future Improvements
- Add a input to sort
- Drop down to filter by genre -> sublist should be alphabitized
- Add new artists to different genres / add new genre
- Improve styles
